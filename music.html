<h1>My Music</h1>
<p>I’ve been writing music since I was a kid, but this past year I really started releasing songs 
and developing my sound.</p>

<h2>My EP: <em>Dinner with a Ghost</em></h2>
<p>This EP explores themes of grief, love, letting go, and memory. Each song comes from 
something personal I’ve lived through.</p>

            <pre>
                I'm getting ready for dinner with a ghost
                He sits at the head of the table, he keeps to his own
                I tell him my jokes, and I hope he cracks a smile, but he won't
                I guess this is how you act when you spend your days all alone

                But I still try to feed him well
                Even if I don't know if he recognizes me anymore

                I'm preppin' for another meal with a ghost
                He sits impatient, waiting for the meal that I specifically chose
                Conversation's flat, and it's all about how he needs
                To work more, work hard, wants me to succeed, and
                I know it all already 'cause he used to say it all the time to me

                Am I loved? I don't know
                People tell me that I am, but I'm not so sure
                Maybe in another life, he'll say the things I wanted to hear
                But he never does and he never will

                I'm getting ready for my last meal with a ghost
                I sit by his side and I tell him all of my jokes
                But he doesn't know and he won't know
                
                I sit by and have my meal with a ghost
                'Cause it's ending now, it's ending now
                I have to feed him his meal
                While he sits there, unaware
                
                (Oo)
                And he sits there, unaware
                (Oo)
                And he sits there, unaware
                (Oo)
                And he sits there, unaware
                'Cause he doesn't know me anymore

                (Ah)
                Bring me to the garden of eden
                Tell me your pretty lies
                (I'm the only one)
                Make me the apple so that
                I'm condemned for life
                Tell me pretty lies like how you
                Love me more than anymore
                Make me believe that you're the only one I've got
                
                And tell me you
                Love me
                Tell me you
                Love me
                
                The apple is rotten
                I figured it out
                It looks pretty from the outside, but
                It tastes bitter in your mouth
                Maybe loving you was dishonest
                But how was I supposed to know?
                First days on Earth where I finally got what I wanted
                
                And tell me you
                Love me
                Tell me you
                Love me
                (Ah)

                I waited for more days
                Than I could ever count
                I can't even tell you
                I waited in the garden
                With the rosebuds
                Waiting for the water
                
                You took me in
                You took care of me
                Where did that go?
                I can't even say a thing
                I am stuck
                In this garden
                Of eternity
                Watch the trees as they lose their leaves
                
                My flowers are wilting
                I keep too much sun
                Where did you go?
                I'm all alone
                All alone
                
                I don't want to be dependent
                But I don't have the choice not to
                I needed you
                
                I lay in the grass
                Don't know how long I'll last
                Time passes me too fast
                
                Mm
                Mm-mm
                Mm
                
                Petals are fallin
                I'm still alive
                I stare at the sky
                And wonder, how is this life?
                You abandoned me
                After making me need you
                Can I still be beautiful
                If you don't water me?

                I wanted to call you, but I didn't
                So maybe I'm better
                Could you tell me if it was worth it
                All these unsent letters?
                
                Surely I fell for a butterfly as only a catcher
                Meant to only admire and let you go
                Like I don't matter
                
                Tell me if you still think of me
                Could you open your eyes and see
                That all I wanted was you with me?
                But you must go
                I know, I know
                
                I reread our old messages
                Funny you can't see any of this
                All of this longing in few sentences
                Tell me, did you keep our promises?
                
                Tell me if you still think of me
                Could you open your eyes and see
                That all I wanted was you with me?
                But you must go
                I know, I know
                
                Running for something
                I don't know what
                My legs are weak
                I have to give up
                Did you believe this was best for us?
                When I gave you all of my trust?
                
                Tell me, do you still think of me?
                Could you open your eyes and see
                That all I needed was you with me?
                But you had to go
                I know, I know, I know
                I know, I know
                Ah
                Mm
