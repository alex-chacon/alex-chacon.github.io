 Hello, World!
 <h1>Welcome to My Page 🌙</h1>
 <p>Hi! I'm Alex — a singer-songwriter and student at CMC. I recently released an EP, titled
 <strong>Dried Rose Petals</strong>.</p>

<img src="IMG_7273.jpg" width="250" alt="photograph I took of a bench under a tree" style=display:inline-block;>
 
<p>This is the first time I've released music that I wrote, sang, and played on guitar :) 
 It was a very cool learning experience!</p>

<h2>About My Music</h2>
<p>My EP, <strong>Dinner with a Ghost</strong>, explores grief, love, and healing. 
 Each song tells a story inspired by real experiences and emotions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Song 1: “Dinner with a Ghost” – about loss and memory</li>
    <li>Song 2: “Garden of Eden” – about being led on by someone</li>
    <li>Song 3: “granddaughter's lullaby” – in rememberance of my grandfather</li>
    <li>Song 4: "flowers" - a remastered song I wrote back in highschool, about dependency</li>
    <li>Song 5: "i know" - a song about accepting someone isn't right for you and letting go</li>
</ul>
