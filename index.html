 Hello, World!
 <h1>Welcome to My Page 🌙</h1>
 <p>Hi! I'm Alex — a singer-songwriter and student at CMC. I recently released an EP, titled
 <strong>Dried Rose Petals</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've released music that I wrote, sang, and played on guitar :) 
 It was a very cool learning experience!</p>
